Augmented MFCC and Rhythm Modeling for Robust Speaker Recognition in Low-Resource Languages :A Case Study on Assamese and Mising 

This project implements two complementary modules to deepen language-aware processing:
- Language Identification: A supervised classifier was trained to automatically detect whether a given speech sample belongs to Assamese or Mising. This improves the system's adaptability to multilingual input and lays the groundwork for language-specific transcription.
- Phonetic & Accent Variation Study: Using techniques like Rhythm Formant Analysis (RFA), the project investigates how individual speakers modify their pronunciation across the two languages. This analysis reveals cross-linguistic influences and enhances the model's robustness to speaker and dialect variation.
